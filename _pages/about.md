My research interest is in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) core to 
Deep Learning and machine learning. 
I mostly focus on Natural Language Understanding (NLU/NLP). 
Currently, I am working on various NLP task such as Entity Recognition, Intent Finding, Machine Comprehension etc. 
Earlier, during my Master's I worked in Database and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory at Tsinghua University, Beijing as a research assistant. 

I also have an interest in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aka speech signal processing. 
As a side project I worked on Computer vision on image segmentation using faster-RCNN and MASK-RCNN.

Before joining my Master's, I was working as a Software Developer and Data Analyst, mostly focus on Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Microsoft SQL Engine 
(Integration, Analysis).
